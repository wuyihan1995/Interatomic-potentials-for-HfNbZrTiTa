# Interatomic-potentials-for-HfNbZrTiTa

Force field files for MD simulations of HfNbZrTiTa-based RHEAs

Format: pair style eam/alloy in LAMMPS. 

Notes: The file HfNbZrTiTa.eam.alloy corresponds to the full-elemental potential containing all five constituent metals; the file Meta-atom.eam.alloy is the tabulated potential containing a hypothetical single element with AVERAGE properties of this HEA.
